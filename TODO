- Instantiate from class Inst
- primitives [DONE]
- Collections
    - List
    - Set
    - Map
    - Array
- interface/abstract classes [advanced feature]
- ergonimics
    - common instantiator (always positive, always negative, fixed number of decimals, ranges etc)


Reasons
- InstantiatorStrategy > Set<T> -> Cant make sets of primitives
